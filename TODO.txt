This is a simple TODO on things  that might be useful to add
- CrUD auto-script to read the database and automatically create CrUD stubs based off of the tables in the database. 
    Make sure to add a parameter to exclude or include
- Controller Filter for User Data...Perhaps Rasmus Lerdorf's suggestion to use the PECL: filter
- Auto Generation of Directory Structure (Is there really any point to this?)
- Documentation on how to get started
