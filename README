-- Written in the form of a FAQ --

"What is this damn package?"
----------------------------------
WYCYDW - pronounced (wi-ked) stands for Write Your Code Your Damn Way
Basically a rather light PHP MVC Framework.
So far it has pretty much nothing in it except a skeleton Model, View and Controller interface.
Doesn't even have a way to map routes yet although some would argue you don't need one.

"How do you use this Damn thing?"
---------------------------------
The way to use is this to write a controller in the controllers directory
There is a default_controller to help you. 

load models in the controller like so
	$this->model('<model_name>');

load views in the controller like so:
	$this->view('<view_name>', $array_of_variables);

load layouts
	$this->layout('<layout_name>');

Place views in views directory
Place models in models directory
Place controllers in controllers directory

A special layouts directory exists for layouts
you can add subdirectories under each to delineate what's what

"What damn packages are included?"
---------------------------------
I have included a copy of JQuery, JQuery.JCrop, JQuery.calendrical, JQuery.cycle, JQuery.datepicker, and swfobject.js for front end use.
I have also included the secureimage php library and a special class I wrote called Repeater for displaying data in a paged format.

"Where are the damn docs?"
---------------------------------
There are no docs yet, I will eventually phpdoc the code at least to get you some references.
See the todo file to see what I have planned.

"Who Wrote this damn package?"
---------------------------------

"Where's the damn FAQ?"
---------------------------------
You're reading it, because I wanted to make the README a FAQ as well.

"What damn server configuration do I need?"
-------------------------------------------
For now it's only Apache
Make sure that mod-rewrite is turned on
and allow for 
	AllowOverride All
